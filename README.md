My original idea was specifically to use matrix multiplication in the context of simulating qubits but I realized that all of that coding could be used for a project
with much more practical use so I changed it to be a matrix calculator. 
I learned how to use tkinter which seems like a pretty useful tool for the future. The calculator itself will also be useful when I take classes involving linear algebra.
I originally wanted to make it capable of calculating with matrices of any order and include determinants but I dropped both cause I was short on time. In hindsight,
it is pretty simple to accomodate the user inputting matrices of any order after I dropped the idea of including determininants. I'd be willing to go back and resubmit/rerecord
with a calculator capable of doing this if I was confident it would improve my grade, but I have lots of other work to do and I can't bring myself to spend any longer on this
project lol.
