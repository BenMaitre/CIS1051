Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I changed my project to be a matrix calculator that can add, subtract, and multiply two 3x3 matrices. I have the functions for each of these operations defined and functioning in the code.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I'm using tkinter to create the ui for inputing the values of the two matrices and deciding what operation to use. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I don't know how to use tkinter. The matrix operations are pretty straightforward translations of the mathematical formulas to code so they weren't an issue.
